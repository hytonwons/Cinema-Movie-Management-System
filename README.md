# Cinema-Movie-Management-System

This is an undergraduate project of mine (in Spring 2015), some of the techniques used are out of fashion from the perspective of industry. But still, the basic web techniques are universal.

In this a J2EE Web Application, I applied Struts + Spring + Hibernate framework for the backend part, MySQL for database, Bootstrap3 for UI, Ajax for some part of the data exchange and Highcharts.js for rendering statistics data.

Use Cases are as follows:
* For Customers:
  * Sign in/up, log out
  * Browse movies sessions, including time, price and theater id
  * Pick a seat, place an order and make payment
  * Deposit and withdraw money to and from his/her account
  * Join new activity
  * Postpone/cancel/resume/expire membership (a timer is needed)
  * Upgrade/degrade membership(opt plans for his/her account)
* For Salesman:
  * Sign in, log out
  * Schedule movie sessions
  * Sell movie tickets to member/non-member
  * Create new activity
* For Managers:
  * Sign in, log out
  * Create salesman account
  * Approve movie sessions
  * View monthly statistical data (data visulazation)
