# Cinema-Movie-Management-System

This is an undergraduate project of mine (in Spring 2015), some of the techniques used are out of fashion from the perspective of industry. But still, the basic web techniques are universal.

In this a J2EE Web Application, I applied Struts + Spring + Hibernate framework for the backend part, MySQL for database, Bootstrap3 for UI, Ajax for some part of the data exchange and Highcharts.js for rendering statistics data.

Use Cases are as follows:
* For Customers:
  * Sign in/up, log out
  * Browse movies sections, including time, price and theater number
  * Pick a seat, place an order and make payment
  * Deposit and withdraw money to and from his/her account
  * Join new activity
  * Postpone/cancel/resume/exp
  * ire membership (a timer is needed)
  * Upgrade/degrade membership
* For Employees:
  * Sign in, log out
  * Schedule movie sections
  * Sell movie tickets to member/non-member
  * Create new activity
* For Managers:
  * Sign in, log out
  * Create employee account
